## Overview
Rock Paper Scissors Game @ Udacity

In this project, you'll apply your Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors. You'll build classes that represent the game and its players. You'll write computer players that follow various different strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.

## My process

I began by created my repository through Git and then cloning to a remote repository on GitHub. I read lots of documentation on dunder methods, classes, inheritance, and methods. I spoke with friends who code, they gave me knowledge, and I learned the importance of OOP. As I began to build the classes and subclasses, the inheritance and subclasses made more sense. I learned that these classes are the players, and those classes take an argument, but they all inherit the same methods from the parent class. The dunder method initializes the data for the object that is created. The self parameter is used to bind the attributes into different classes. The special name variable's value is set to main, which executes the python file when invoked directly vs being imported as a module. The use of f-string literals helped make the code more readable and efficient. Class level variables are accessed and shared amongst all of the objects. The instance variables are declared in the class, but outside the method. This project was the best project I've developed, becuase I spear-headed my learning curve and understood the code as best I could. Udacity did a really great job of teaching and mentoring me as well. The documentation I found on these concepts really was the icing on the cake. I realized, we are creating the Objects and Classes being used, and to access the default behavior, we need to write special syntax for that.  

### Built with

Python 

### Continued development

After being introduced to Python, this was my second project, it was a major leap and challenge for me, but it really was worth it in the end. I enjoy Object Orientated Programming.
